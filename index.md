**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain was the anatomy of the power pole, because it helped me understand how electricity travels throughout the city. For the different lines, there are different voltage strengths which not only determines their function in the power grid but also affects the level of safety precautions required when working near them. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
One potential investigation that I would like to pursue is exploring how different types of jobs or work orders (ex. emergency repairs vs. planned maintenance) impact technician utilization and scheduling efficiency. It would be interesting to see if certain job categories consistently lead to lower utilization and how we can use this information to make a system to predict work order volume each week for the scheduling team.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One potential change in my approach for my current Quarter 1 Project is to incorporate predictive modeling in the project. Building a simple regression or forecasting model could have helped estimate utilization rates based on job characteristics and scheduling patterns, leading to more data-driven recommendations.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Other techniques that I would be intereseted in using for the project is include clustering or classification methods to group technicians or jobs with similar patterns of utilization. Using these techniques could help uncover hidden patterns and inform strategies for improving scheduling and resource allocation.
